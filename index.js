// What is javascript and where is it used?
// JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic content on websites, allowing developers to create features such as animations, form validations, and real-time updates. JavaScript can be executed in web browsers, making it an essential tool for front-end development. Additionally, with the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, enabling developers to build full-stack applications using a single programming language.
